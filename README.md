#  HR Employee Flow Analytics Dashboard | Excel & Slicers

This project delivers a fully interactive HR analytics dashboard built in Excel, designed to provide dynamic insights into workforce health, turnover risk, and organizational growth trends. The goal was to transform static HR data into actionable business intelligence using Pivot Tables and advanced Excel functionality.

##  Problem Statement

The organization faced challenges due to a lack of consolidated, real-time metrics on employee flow. This resulted in reactive staffing decisions and an inability to proactively address emerging retention risks. Key questions that needed answers included:

1.  Which **departments** and **age groups** pose the highest attrition risk relative to their size?
2.  What is the company's true **attrition rate**, and how does it correlate with employee demographics?
3.  Are current **hiring trends** supporting the organization’s long-term growth needs?

This dashboard was developed to centralize these metrics and provide HR Business Partners and management with a dynamic, filterable tool for strategic workforce planning.
